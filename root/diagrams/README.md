# Diagrams

This folder contains visual representations of the Terraform-managed AWS resources.

Files
- `aws-architecture.mmd` — Mermaid diagram (high-level) of the network and compute layout.
- `terraform-graph.dot` — DOT-format dependency graph generated by `terraform graph`.

How to view
- In VS Code: open `aws-architecture.mmd` and use a Mermaid preview extension (e.g. "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support").
- Render Mermaid to PNG/SVG with mermaid-cli:

```powershell
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
mmdc -i aws-architecture.mmd -o aws-architecture.png
```

- Render DOT (Graphviz) to PNG (requires Graphviz installed):

```powershell
dot -Tpng terraform-graph.dot -o terraform-graph.png
```

Notes
- The Mermaid diagram is a high-level representation inferred from Terraform modules in `root`. Some modules (like `lamp_asg`, `rds_mysql`, `s3_backup`, `security_group`) are placeholders or empty in the repo; the diagram uses placeholders for them.
